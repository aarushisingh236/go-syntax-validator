# Go Language Analyzer

A command-line Python tool that analyzes a subset of the Go programming language by performing **lexical analysis, parsing, and static type checking**.  
It builds and displays an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** and reports syntax and semantic errors in Go-like programs.

This project demonstrates strong use of:
- Compiler design concepts  
- Parsing with PLY (Lex/Yacc)  
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)  
- Symbol tables and scope resolution  
- Static type checking  
- Command-line tool development  

---

## Features

Supports:
- Variable declarations and assignments  
- If-Else statements  
- For loops  
- Switch-Case-Default statements  
- Arithmetic and comparison expressions  

Additional capabilities:
- Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)  
- Detects undeclared variables and type mismatches  
- Handles nested scopes using a symbol table  
- Command-line interface:
  - `--ast` to display the AST  
  - `--check` to validate code

## Data Structures Used

- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**  
  Represents the hierarchical structure of the program.

- **Symbol Table (Dictionary with Scope Stack)**  
  Stores variable names and their types across nested scopes.

- **Token List**  
  Generated by the lexer to represent keywords, identifiers, and operators.

## Algorithm

1. Tokenize source code using lexical analysis  
2. Parse tokens and construct the AST  
3. Build symbol table and resolve scopes  
4. Perform semantic analysis and static type checking  
5. Display AST or report errors

## How to Run

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run and display AST
```
python src/main.py samples/sample.go --ast
```
### Run and only validate code
```
python src/main.py samples/sample.go --check
```
